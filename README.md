# Beyond the Edge — Tutorial

[Quantifying, representing and analyse higher-order interactions](https://Mattehub.github.io/beyond-the-edge-tutorial/webpage)

**Tutorial and hackathon, scheduled 9th and 10th October**

## Organizers

[Fernando Santos](https://ias.uva.nl/community/fellows/current-fellows/marilyn-gatica.html), University of Amsterdam.  

[Leonardo Di Gaetano](https://www.gbhi.org/profiles/carlos-coronel), Institute of Neuroscience of la Timone, Marseille, France.

[Matteo Neri](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=ubwQC-AAAAAJ&hl=it), Institute of Neuroscience of la Timone, Marseille, France.  

**Overview**  
In this tutorial we will explore different methodologies to investigate higher-order interactions through different lenses, 
from information theory to computational modeling. The tutorial is organized in two days. On Thursday afternoon,
we will have a series of talks from organizers, in which the most used
higher-order computational toolboxes will be presented. On Friday we will have hands-on sessions and a hackathon, in which participants will be divided into three groups to work on the three different research questions and three different data sets.

##  Dependencies (Important!)

To ensure the tutorials run smoothly, **please install the required packages** for each part of the workshop:

- ✅ [**HOI package**](https://github.com/brainets/hoi)
- ✅ [**XGI package**](https://xgi.readthedocs.io/en/stable/installing.html)
- ✅ [**HypergraphX package**](https://hypergraphx.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)

> ⚠️ **Note:** We recommend creating a virtual environment (e.g., with `conda`) before installing the dependencies.
