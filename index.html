      <h2>Overview</h2>
      <p> In this tutorial we will explore different methodologies 
      to investigate higher-order interactions through different lenses, from information 
      theory to computational modeling. The tutorial is organized in two days. On Thursday afternoon,
      we will have a series of talks from invited speakers and organizers, in which the most used
      higher-order computational toolboxes will be presented. On Friday we will
      focus on hands-on sessions and a hackathon, in which participants will be divided into three groups
      to work on the three following topics:</p>
      <p><strong>Higher-order brain connectivity</strong>. This group will work on the analysis of higher-order
      interactions in brain data, using hypergraphs and simplicial complexes. The structure of higher-order 
      brain connectivity will be explored through various methods, levaraging the theoretical results 
      learned during the workshop. Importantly, the value of the edges of the brain hypergraphed that 
      will be used in this group will be provided to the participants, so that no prior knowledge of
      neuroimaging data analysis will be required. However, it is important to consider that the value of each
      higher-order edge has been computed from neuroimaging data, using information theoretic measures as 
      the O-information, Total Correlation and Dual Total Correlation. </p>
